        <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          We believe in one true and living God who exists in three persons: God
          the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit. This
          belief in the Holy Trinity is central to our understanding of Godâ€™s
          nature. Each person is fully God, co-equal and co-eternal, yet they
          are one in essence and purpose.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 mb-4">Jesus Christ</h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          We believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, fully God and fully
          man, who came to Earth to reveal God's love and to provide salvation
          through His death on the cross and His resurrection. His life,
          teachings, death, and resurrection form the foundation of the
          Christian faith. He is the Savior of all who trust in Him for
          forgiveness and eternal life.

          The Holy Spirit
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          We believe in the Holy Spirit, who proceeds from the Father and the
          Son. The Holy Spirit is present and active in the world today,
          convicting the world of sin, empowering believers for service, and
          guiding the Church into all truth. He brings spiritual transformation
          and helps believers grow in holiness and Christlikeness.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 mb-4">The Bible</h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          We believe the Bible is the inspired, infallible Word of God. It is
          the authoritative guide for our lives and is fully trustworthy for
          doctrine, reproof, correction, and instruction in righteousness. The
          Bible is God's revelation of Himself to humanity and is meant to lead
          us into a personal relationship with Him.

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 mb-4">Salvation</h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          We believe that salvation is by grace alone through faith in Jesus
          Christ. It is not by works or human effort but is a free gift from
          God. Through Jesus' death and resurrection, we are forgiven for our
          sins and reconciled to God. Salvation is available to everyone who
          believes and accepts Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 mb-4">The Church</h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          We believe that the Church is the Body of Christ, made up of all
          believers worldwide. The Church exists to worship God, build up
          believers, and reach out to the world with the Gospel. It is called to
          love, serve, and make disciples, fulfilling the Great Commission given
          by Jesus Christ. The local church is an expression of the universal
          Church, where believers gather for fellowship, teaching, and ministry.

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 mb-4">Eternal Life</h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          We believe in eternal life through Jesus Christ. Those who trust in
          Him receive the gift of eternal life, which begins now and continues
          beyond death. Believers are assured of a future with God in heaven,
          while those who reject Christ face eternal separation from God. We
          eagerly await the return of Christ to establish His eternal Kingdom.

          The Return of Christ
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          We believe in the second coming of Jesus Christ. He will return in
          glory to judge the living and the dead. His return will mark the end
          of this age and the beginning of His reign in a new heaven and a new
          earth. We are called to live in anticipation of His return, remaining
          faithful to His teachings and mission.
