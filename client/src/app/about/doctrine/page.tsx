        <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          We believe that the Bible, both the Old and New Testaments, is the
          inspired and infallible word of God. It is our final authority in all
          matters of faith, life, and conduct. We uphold the principles of the
          Scriptures as the foundation of our beliefs and actions, ensuring that
          all teachings are rooted in its truth.

          The Holy Trinity
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          We believe in the existence of the Holy Trinity—God the Father, God
          the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Each person of the Trinity is
          distinct, yet co-equal, eternal, and unified. We worship the one true
          God in all His glory, recognizing His roles in creation, redemption,
          and sanctification.

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          Salvation is a free gift from God, made available through the grace of
          Jesus Christ. We believe that salvation comes through faith in Jesus
          Christ, who died for our sins and rose again for our justification. It
          is by His grace, not by works, that we are saved. Every person must
          personally accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior to experience true
          salvation.

          Baptism and Communion
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          Baptism is an important act of obedience, signifying the believer’s
          identification with the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus
          Christ. It is performed by immersion in water. Communion, also known
          as the Lord's Supper, is a sacred practice wherein we remember and
          celebrate the body and blood of Jesus Christ, symbolized by the bread
          and wine.

          The Holy Spirit
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          We believe in the active presence of the Holy Spirit in the life of
          every believer. The Holy Spirit empowers, guides, and equips us for
          living a godly life and fulfilling the mission of spreading the
          Gospel. He convicts of sin, comforts, and strengthens believers, and
          gives spiritual gifts for service in the kingdom of God.

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          The Church is the Body of Christ, composed of all believers worldwide.
          We believe in the universal Church and the local expression of the
          Church. Our mission is to worship God, make disciples, and serve
          others. The Church serves as a place for believers to gather, grow in
          faith, and be equipped to fulfill the Great Commission.

          The Return of Christ

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          We believe in the second coming of Jesus Christ, who will return to
          gather His Church and establish His eternal kingdom. The return of
          Christ will bring justice, righteousness, and peace to the earth. We
          look forward to His return with great anticipation, knowing that He
          will make all things new.
